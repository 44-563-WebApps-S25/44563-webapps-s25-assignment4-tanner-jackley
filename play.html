           SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
            Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
            SAMPSON
            Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
            GREGORY
            No, for then we should be colliers.
            SAMPSON
            I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
            GREGORY
            Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
            SAMPSON
            I strike quickly, being moved.
            GREGORY
            But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
            SAMPSON
            A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
            GREGORY
            To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
            therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
            SAMPSON
            A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
            take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
