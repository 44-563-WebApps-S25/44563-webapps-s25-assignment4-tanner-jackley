           <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
            <p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>
            <h5>SAMPSON</h5>
            <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
            <h5>GREGORY</h5>
            <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
            <h5>SAMPSON</h5>
            <p>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</p>
            <h5>GREGORY</h5>
            <p>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</p>
            <h5>SAMPSON</h5>
            <p>I strike quickly, being moved.</p>
            <h5>GREGORY</h5>
            <p>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>
            <h5>SAMPSON</h5>
            <p>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>
            <h5>GREGORY</h5>
            <p>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
                therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</p>
                <h5>SAMPSON</h5>
            <p>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
                take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. </p>
